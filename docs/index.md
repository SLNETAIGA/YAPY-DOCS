# Welcome to YAPY Docs

YAPY(Yet Another PYthon) - it's minimal implementation of Python and Python VM.  
Yapy have a syntax very similar Python 3.x syntax, in many places it is even compatable with CPython 3.x.

## How is Yapy is works?
In yapy implemented python vm like virtual machine and simple pattern based lexer and parser.  
When we run any Yapy program it's compiles into bytecode and then evaluating(as in CPython).  

## What is implemented in Yapy
* REPL
* Virtual machine
* Basic types(number/string/list/dictionary)
* Classes
* Modules
* Locals and globals variables
* Raise/try/catch and exception's
* Standart libraries(sys,os,math,time)(NOT FINISHED, MORE STUFF NOT IMPLEMENTED)
* while/for ... in ... loops
* ... a big count of builtins...

## TODO
* Lambdas
* Fix a lot of bugs.
* Make it's more compatable with CPython.
